    "We are revisiting a transshipment problem similar to one that we solved in the second class of Week 2. In this problem, Elmore's Ski Boots is the manufacturer of the finest ski boots available. There are three plants that manufacture the boots, two distribution centers, and five warehouses. We need to ship the boots to the warehouses at a minimum cost satisfying the constraints outlined in the spreadsheet. Namely, each plant can only produce so much product, the amount of boots passing through the distribution centers has to remain constant (in has to equal out), and each warehouse has a minimum amount that they need in order to satisfy demand. The data are given in the Excel file `quiz-1.xlsx`."
